# ROBOFRIENDS

This is my first react app that I learned from [Udemy]( https://www.udemy.com/), [The Complete Web Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery]( https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/). It is a Contact app that searches the contacts of people/users with their email, full name and an avatar  when searching up their names. Used [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) as API for the users/peoples contacts as fake data and this API is good for testing purposes. Instead of using random pictures of people, I used robot images from [robohash](https://robohash.org/) that generates random robots for you.
